HydroGym provides is an open-source library of challenge problems in data-driven modeling and control of fluid dynamics.

### Features
* __Hierarchical:__ Designed for analysis and controller design from a high-level black-box interface to low-level operator access
    - High-level: `hydrogym.env.FlowEnv` classes implement the OpenAI `gym.Env` interface
    - Intermediate: Typical CFD interface with `hydrogym.FlowConfig` and `hydrogym.TransientSolver` classes
    - Low-level: Access to linearized operators and sparse scipy or PETSc CSR matrices
* __Differentiable:__ Adjoint-enabled for PDE-constrained optimization via pyadjoint (extensible to PyTorch, Jax, etc... planned for future)
* __Modeling and anlysis tools:__ Global stability analysis (via SLEPc) and modal decompositions (via modred)
* __Scalable:__ Since linear algebra backend is PETSc, fully parallelized with MPI (including pyadjoint, SLEPc, modred)

# Quick Start

## Docker Installation
The easiest way to get started is with the Docker container.  Assuming you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), you can build and launch the image easily with the scripts in the `docker` folder:

```bash
cd docker && ./build.sh
./launch.sh
```

Note that building the image will take a while the first time, but you shouldn't have to do it again unless you change the configuration.

Once you're in the docker container, the first thing to do is activate the virtual environment where all of the important packages are installed with

```bash
source $VENV/bin/activate
```

If you try to run something and get an error like "python: command not found" you probably missed this step.

## Native Installation
Alternatively, you can use hydrogym without docker by installing the required dependencies into a local folder.
Before you do that, make sure that the following software is available in your system:
```bash
build-essential, autoconf, automake, bison, flex, cmake, gfortran, git, libtool, python3-dev, python3-pip, python3-tk, python3-venv, zlib1g-dev, libboost-dev 
```
Then you can build all dependencies using the `setup.sh` script:
```bash
Usage:
  bash ./setup.sh <INSTALL_PATH> [options]

Options:
  --complex                 Build firedrake-complex
  --use-preinstalled-mpi    Use preinstalled MPI version
                            (Make sue that mpicc, mpicxx, mpif90, mpiexec are defined)
```
Please keep in mind that the building process may take an hour or more (depending on your system).
Once the script has finished, the first thing to do is activate the virtual environment where all of the important packages are installed with
```bash
source <INSTALL_PATH>/firedrake/bin/activate
```
or in case of firedrake-complex:
```bash
source <INSTALL_PATH>/firedrake-complex/bin/activate
```

## Example
After installation you can get running in the interpreter as easy as:

```python
import hydrogym as gym
env = gym.env.CylEnv(Re=100) # Cylinder wake flow configuration
for i in range(num_steps):
	action = 0.0   # Put your control law here
    (lift, drag), reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

Or to test that you can run things in parallel, try to run the steady-state Newton solver on the cylinder wake with 4 processors:

```bash
cd /home/hydrogym/examples/cylinder
mpiexec -np 4 python solve-steady.py
```

# Flow configurations

There are currently a number of main flow configurations, the most prominent of which are:

- Periodic cyclinder wake at Re=100
- Chaotic pinball at Re=130
- Open cavity at Re=7500

with visualizations of the flow configurations available in the [docs](docs/FlowConfigurations.md). For the time being the cylinder wake is the most well-developed flow configuration, although the pinball should also be pretty reliable.  The cavity is in development (the boundary conditions are a little iffy and there's no actuation implemented yet) and the backwards-facing step is still planned.
